# Getting Started with React Admin for ApiLogicServer

This is the source code for a React Admin app, generated by [APILogicServer](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer). 

[View live demo!](https://apilogicserver.askteam.how/) 
(username is admin and password is p)

You can run it locally as described below in [Installation](#Installation).

# Background

API Logic Server introspects your database and creates customizable project from a single command:

```
ApiLogicServer run  # defaults to pre-installed sample database
```

ApiLogicServer creates the [complete project below]((#generated-project)) from your data model, including:
* **Models:** SQLAlchemy requires model classes; these are created automatically from the database
  * You can customize the model, e.g., [denormalizations](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/Denormalization), [hybrid (virtual) attributes](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/Denormalization), and [supply missing relationships](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/Managing-Rules#relationships-db-or-virtual).
  
* [**API:**](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer#api-safrs-jsonapi-and-swagger) a JSON:API, used by the react-admin app
* [**Logic:**](https://github.com/valhuber/ApiLogicServer#logic) declare transactional logic using spreadsheet-like rules (multi-table derivations and constraints)
  * 40x more concise than code, extensible with standard python
* [**UI:**](#multi-page-multi-table-application) multi-page, multi-table react-admin apps as shown below
